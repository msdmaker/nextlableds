Git Workflow
--

Hey friends, if you wish to create any content or features, please create a meaningful branch name and push that to the origin. Once the feature is completed, it can be integration tested/bugshot on the dev branch; once stable, dev can to be merged onto master. This way we can keep master stable, and have a hotbed for smoothing out any integration kerfuffle.
